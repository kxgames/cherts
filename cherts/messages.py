# that is called once the message will no longer be sent over the network.  
# Specifically, this would be after `on_check()` but before `on_execute()`.
#
# This would be useful in SetupWorld, to create tokens from the config 
# dictionary.  Right now this is done in `tokens_to_add()`, which is fine, but 
# requires knowing that `tokens_to_add()` is called before `on_execute()`, 
# which isn't obvious.
